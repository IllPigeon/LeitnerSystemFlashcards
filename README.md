# LeitnerSystemFlashcards
Flashcard studying thing made entirely in Java based off the Leitner System of studying.
This branch is made using IntellIJ IDE.

Point of the project is to try and best use OOP principles and make a fairly navigable menu for user input inside of the console.
It's pretty crude since it relies on the console for interaction, so am considering using JavaFX to make it more visually appealing
and satisfying to interact with.
